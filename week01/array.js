// PROBLEM
// You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the
// sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no
// index that would make this happen, return -1.
let array = [1,2,3];

const job = [1,2,3,4,3,2,1];

function findEvenIndex(arr) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        left = 0;
        right = 0;




    }
}
findEvenIndex(job);
