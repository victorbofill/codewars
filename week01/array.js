// PROBLEM
// You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the
// sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no
// index that would make this happen, return -1.
let array = [1,2,3];

function findEvenIndex(arr)
{
    let number;

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    }


// add every number to its left
// add every number to its right
// compare the numbers



}
